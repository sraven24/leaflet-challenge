# Leaflet-challenge
In this challenge, data from the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, will be used to chart the depth and magnitude of earthquakes in the united states.  A map was created using the leaflet library that allows the user to pull the current data from a set period of time. The code will then map out all the earthquakes that happened during that period of time and display where the quake happend in the form of the circle denoting the  magnitude and a color which will represent the depth.

# Installation
The user should be able to run the index.html file to have the map created.

# Resources
Of course this assignment uses the leaflet library found at https://leafletjs.com/ as well as data from the USGS site. Much of the information used for this project was gleaned from the in class assignments.  Additional sources are as follows:
